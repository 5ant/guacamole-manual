    <para>Reports that all operations as of the given server-relative timestamp
        have been completed. If a sync is received from the server, the client
        must respond with a corresponding sync once all previous operations have
        been completed, or the server may stop sending updates until the client
        catches up. For the client, sending a sync with a timestamp newer than
        any timestamp received from the server is an error.</para>
    <para>Both client and server are expected to occasionally send sync to
        report on current operation execution state.</para>
