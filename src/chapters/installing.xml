        <para>Guacamole is included in the repositories of several Linux distributions. If your
            distribution provides Guacamole packages for you, this is the preferred method of
            installing Guacamole. If your distribution does not provide Guacamole packages, or the
            packages provided are too old, you can build Guacamole from source fairly easily.</para>
        <important>
            <para>Be aware that Guacamole is a remote desktop gateway, and
                cannot access your desktop's display without a remote desktop
                server of some kind to connect to. Guacamole does not contain
                its own VNC or RDP server, and these installation procedures
                will not walk you through the installation of a VNC or RDP
                server.</para>
            <para>Your distribution of choice will provide documentation for
                setting up VNC, as will the documentation provided by those that
                created the VNC server you wish to use. If you are going to use
                RDP to connect to Windows computers, Microsoft (and many others
                on the internet) provides documentation describing how to set up
                remote desktop.</para>
        </important>
        <para>Installing Guacamole from your distribution's <package>guacamole</package> package will
            typically install the web application and the proxy <package>guacd</package>, along with
            support for VNC (<package>libguac-client-vnc</package>). If you want support for RDP or
            SSH, you will need to install those packages as well.</para>
        <para>After the Guacamole packages are installed, the web application may still need to be
            deployed to your servlet container. Some packages, like the Debian package called
                <package>guacamole-tomcat</package>, will do this for you, but if your distribution
            provides no such package, you will have to deploy Guacamole yourself.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Debian and Ubuntu</title>
            <para>The Debian repositories contain packages for all of Guacamole's components, and
                Ubuntu has inherited those packages (being Debian-based).</para>
            <para>For users of Debian or any flavor of Ubuntu, installing Guacamole is as simple as
                installing the <package>guacamole-tomcat</package> package, and then editing the
                    <filename>/etc/guacamole/user-mapping.xml</filename> file to add some
                connections. The <package>guacamole-tomcat</package> package will install Tomcat and
                automatically create the necessary symbolic links to deploy Guacamole. If you don't
                want to use Tomcat, or you want to deploy Guacamole manually, you can install the
                    <package>guacamole</package> package instead, and follow the deployment
                instructions provided in this chapter.</para>

            </informalexample>
            <para>If you install the <package>guacamole-tomcat</package> package, you will be
                prompted for whether you wish to restart Tomcat automatically. Tomcat must be
                restarted after Guacamole is installed or upgraded. If you don't want to do this, or
                you want to do this manually, choose "No" (the default). Choosing "Yes" will restart
                Tomcat for this and future installs of Guacamole.</para>
            <para>By default, VNC support will be installed as a dependency of the
                    <package>guacamole</package> package. If you want SSH or RDP support, you will
                need to install <package>libguac-client-ssh0</package> or
                    <package>libguac-client-rdp0</package> manually:</para>
            <informalexample>
                <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>apt-get install libguac-client-ssh0 libguac-client-rdp0</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt> </screen>
                <para>Recent versions of Debian and Ubuntu have a recent-enough version of FreeRDP
                    and include <package>libguac-client-rdp0</package>, but if you're using an older
                    version of Debian (such as Debian 6.0 a.k.a. "squeeze"), you will have to either
                    do without RDP support or install FreeRDP and
                        <package>guacamole-server</package> manually, without using your
                    distribution's packages.</para>
                <para>Once installed, both Tomcat and <package>guacd</package> will start
                    automatically and on boot.</para>

            <title>Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS</title>
            <para>Fedora has an excellent Guacamole package, <package>guacamole</package>, which
                will automatically install deploy Guacamole to Tomcat. It does not depend on
                    <package>guacd</package>, however, and you thus must install the
                    <package>guacd</package> package manually alongside
                <package>guacamole</package>:</para>
            <informalexample>
                <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>yum install guacamole guacd</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt> </screen>
            </informalexample>
            <para>Depending on which protocols you require support for, you will need to install one
                of the <package>libguac-client-*</package> packages to provide support for those
                protocols. Most users will want at least <package>libguac-client-vnc</package>. If
                you want SSH support, or access to RDP servers, you will need to install
                    <package>libguac-client-ssh</package> or <package>libguac-client-rdp</package>
                respectively.</para>
            <informalexample>
                <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>yum install libguac-client-vnc libguac-client-ssh libguac-client-rdp</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt> </screen>
            </informalexample>
            <para>Neither RHEL nor CentOS include Guacamole packages in their main repositories,
                however Fedora maintains a repository called EPEL which contains binaries compatible
                with both RHEL and CentOS. The EPEL repository contains the Guacamole packages
                described above. If you wish to install Guacamole on RHEL or CentOS, you should
                either add the EPEL repository and install from that, or build Guacamole from
                source.</para>
            <para>Once everything is installed, you will still need to configure
                    <package>guacd</package> and Tomcat to start automatically on boot (assuming
                this is what you want):</para>
            <informalexample>
                <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>chkconfig tomcat6 on</userinput>
<computeroutput>Note: forwarding request to 'systemctl enable tomcat6.service'

<prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>chkconfig guacd on</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt></screen>
            </informalexample>
            <para>If you don't want Tomcat and guacd to start automatically, you can start them
                manually instead:</para>
            <informalexample>
                <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>service tomcat6 start</userinput>

            </informalexample>
            <para>At this point, all you need to do is edit the
                    <filename>/etc/guacamole/user-mapping.xml</filename> file to add some
                connections. You do not need to restart Tomcat after editing this file; it will be
                reloaded automatically by Guacamole.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Other distributions</title>
            <para>If you distribution isn't listed above, there is still a chance your distribution
                provides Guacamole packages. A search for "guacamole" in your distribution's package
                manage should answer that question quickly. If no package is provided, your only
                option is to build Guacamole from source.</para>
            <para>Building Guacamole from source is not hard. In most cases, all you need to do is
                download the latest source for <package>guacamole-server</package>, and the latest
                guacamole.war from the Guacamole project website, build
                    <package>guacamole-server</package>, and then deploy
                    <filename>guacamole.war</filename>.</para>
            <para>The method for installing Guacamole is fairly constant across platforms, and the
                instructions given here should apply almost universally (and in the case that they
                don't, you probably already know what you need to do).</para>

        <para>Building the components of Guacamole from source is not difficult, providing you have
            the necessary tools installed already. The source for the entirety of Guacamole is
            available from the Guacamole project web site in convenient source archives, each named
            after the component they contain. Each archive also contains a file named
                <filename>README</filename> which lists detailed instructions for building and
            installing. </para>
        <para>Guacamole is separated into two pieces: <package>guacamole-server</package>, which
            provides the <package>guacd</package> proxy and related libraries, and
                <package>guacamole-client</package>, which provides the client to be served by your
            servlet container. In most cases, the only source you will need to build is
                <package>guacamole-server</package>, and downloading the latest
                <filename>guacamole.war</filename> from the project website will be sufficient to
            provide the client. Building <package>guacamole-client</package> is really only
            necessary when you wish to modify the source or when you want to try the latest
            unreleased changes.</para>
        <para>To compile the C components, you will need a C compiler (such as
                <package>gcc</package>) and the libraries that each component depends on. Note that
            many Linux distribution separates library packages into binary and "development"
            packages; you will need to install the development packages. These will usually end in a
            "-dev" or "-devel" suffix.</para>

            <para><package>guacamole-server</package> contains all the native, server-side
                components required by Guacamole to connect to remote desktops. It provides a common
                C library, <package>libguac</package>, which all other native components depend on,
                as well as separate libraries for each supported protocol, and a proxy daemon,
                    <package>guacd</package>, the heart of Guacamole.</para>
            <para><package>guacd</package> is the proxy daemon that runs on your Guacamole server,
                accepting connections from the Guacamole web application on behalf of remote users.
                It effectively translates between common remote desktop protocols like VNC or RDP by
                dynamically loading protocol support plugins. Building <package>guacd</package>
                creates an executable called <filename>guacd</filename> which can be run manually
                or, if you wish, automatically when your computer starts up.</para>
            <para>In order to build <package>guacamole-server</package>, you will need
                    <package>Cairo</package>, a graphics library, and <package>libpng</package>, the
                official PNG library. These libraries are strictly required <emphasis>in all
                    cases</emphasis>. Guacamole cannot be built without them. The other dependencies
                of <package>guacamole-server</package> are optional. Which libraries you will need
                to install depends on what support you need.</para>
            <para>Guacamole currently supports VNC, RDP, and SSH. Each protocol corresponds to a
                separate library that will be built with <package>guacamole-server</package> if you
                have its corresponding optional dependencies. VNC support depends on the
                    <package>libvncclient</package> library, which is part of
                    <package>libVNCServer</package>, RDP support depends on a recent version of
                    <package>FreeRDP</package> - 1.0 or higher, and SSH support depends on
                    <package>libssh</package> and <package>Pango</package>, a font rendering and
                text layout library.</para>
            <para>Optional features of these protocols will be enabled if you have other libraries
                installed as well. Currently, the RDP support also provides sound encoded with Ogg
                Vorbis if you have <package>libvorbis</package> installed while building
                    <package>guacamole-server</package>.</para>
            <para>You can obtain a copy of the <package>guacamole-server</package> source from the
                Guacamole project web site if you want the latest released code. These releases are
                stable snapshots of the latest code which have undergone enough testing that the
                Guacamole team considers them fit for public consumption. Source downloaded from the
                project web site will take the form of a <filename>.tar.gz</filename> archive which
                you can extract from the command line:</para>

                Guacamole project for <package>guacamole-server</package>. Running

                is missing, the script will fail outright, and you will need to install the missing
                dependency. If, after running <filename>configure</filename>, you find support for

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

                These components ultimately make up the web application that will serve the HTML5
                Guacamole client to users that connect to your server. This web application will
                connect to <package>guacd</package>, part of <package>guacamole-server</package>, on
                behalf of connected users in order to serve them any remote desktop they are
                authorized to access.</para>
            <para>Normally, you don't need to build <package>guacamole-client</package> manually, as
                it is written in Java and is cross-platform. The easiest way to obtain the latest
                version of <package>guacamole-client</package> is to simply download the latest
                    <filename>guacamole.war</filename> (the compiled form of
                    <package>guacamole-client</package>) from the Guacamole project web site.</para>
            <para>To compile <package>guacamole-client</package>, all you need is Apache Maven and a
                copy of the Java JDK. Most, if not all, Linux distributions will provide packages

            <para>You can obtain a copy of the <package>guacamole-client</package> source from the
                Guacamole project web site if you want the latest released code. These releases are
                stable snapshots of the latest code which have undergone enough testing that the
                Guacamole team considers them fit for public consumption. Source downloaded from the

                and don't care that the code hasn't been as rigorously tested as the code in stable
                releases, you can also clone the unstable branch from the Guacamole team's git

            <para>Unlike <package>guacamole-server</package>, even if you grab the code from the git

            <para>Once the Guacamole web application is built, there will be a .war file in the

                (the directory you were in when you ran <application>mvn</application>). This
                    <filename>.war</filename> file contains the entirety of the Guacamole web
                application, including all dependencies. Installing Guacamole means copying this
                    <filename>.war</filename> file into the directory required by your servlet

        <indexterm>
            <primary>deploying</primary>
        </indexterm>
        <para>Typically, deploying Guacamole is a one-time process, and needs to be done only when
            Guacamole is initially installed. If done correctly, future upgrades to Guacamole will
            be automatically deployed.</para>
        <para>There are two critical files involved in the deployment of Guacamole:
                <filename>guacamole.war</filename>, which is the file containing the web
            application, and <filename>guacamole.properties</filename>, the main configuration file
            for Guacamole. The recommend way to set up Guacamole involves placing these files in
            standard locations, and then creating symbolic links to them so that Tomcat can find
            them.</para>
        <para>Ultimately, the <filename>guacamole.war</filename> file, or a symbolic link to it,
            must be found by your servler container within the directory it uses for
                <filename>.war</filename> files, and the <filename>guacamole.properties</filename>
            file must be within the <filename>.guacamole</filename> directory in the home directory
            of the user your servlet container runs as. Legacy installations will have
                <filename>guacamole.properties</filename> placed in the classpath of the servlet
            container, but this is officially deprecated, and will be unsupported in future
            releases.</para>
        <para>We recommend placing <filename>guacamole.properties</filename> and any other
            configuration files in <filename>/etc/guacamole</filename>, and
                <filename>guacamole.war</filename> in <filename>/var/lib/guacamole</filename>. You
            will likely have to create each of these directories manually, as root.</para>
        <para>With these files in place, you can create symbolic links in the places Tomcat and
            Guacamole require them, such that future upgrades will only involve placing the new
            files in standard locations. The standard locations involved are the Tomcat
                "<filename>webapps</filename>" directory (below,
                <filename>/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps</filename>, but your installation may be
            different), and the "<filename>.guacamole</filename>" directory, which must be manually
            created within the Tomcat user's home directory.</para>
        <informalexample>
            <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>ln -s /var/lib/guacamole/guacamole.war <replaceable>/var/lib/tomcat6</replaceable>/webapps</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>ln -s /etc/guacamole/guacamole.properties <replaceable>/usr/share/tomcat6</replaceable>/.guacamole/</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt></screen>
        </informalexample>
        <para>If you are using a different servlet container or Tomcat is installed in a different
            location, you will need to replace the directories above with the corresponding
            directories of your install.</para>
        <para>Once Guacamole has been deployed, Tomcat must be restarted (as
                <filename>guacamole.properties</filename> will only be read on servlet container
            start) and the guacd daemon must be started if it isn't running already. After
            restarting Tomcat and starting guacd, Guacamole is successfully installed and
            running.</para>
        <para>The command to restart Tomcat and guacd will vary by distribution. Typically, you can
            do this by running the corresponding init scripts with the "restart" option:</para>
        <informalexample>
            <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>/etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart</userinput>
<computeroutput>Stopping Tomcat... OK

        <para>If you want Guacamole to start on boot, you will need to configure the tomcat6 and
            guacd services to run automatically. Your distribution will provide documentation for
            doing this.</para>
