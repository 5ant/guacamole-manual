        <title>Description</title>
        <para>Reports that all operations as of the given server-relative timestamp have been completed.When sent by the server, sync indicates that the given timestamp is the current timestamp as of all previous operations. When sent by the client, sync indicates that all operations prior to the given timestamp have been completed.Both client and server are expected to occasionally send sync to report on current operation execution state. If a sync is received from the server, the client should respond with a corresponding sync once all previous operations have been completed, or the server may stop sending updates until the client catches up.For the client, sending a sync with a timestamp newer than any timestamp received from the server is an error.</para>
