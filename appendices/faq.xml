            <question>
                <para>
                    What is does "clientless" mean?
                </para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>
                The term "clientless" means that no specific client is needed.
                A Guacamole user needs only have an HTML5 web browser
                installed, which is exceedingly common; virtually all modern
                computers and mobile devices have such a browser installed by
                default.
                </para>
                <para>
                    In this sense, Guacamole is "clientless" in that it does
                    not require any additional software to be installed
                    beyond what is considered standard for any computer.
