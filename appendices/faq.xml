            <question>
                <para>
                    Where does the name "Guacamole" come from?
                </para>

            <question>
                <para>
                    What is does "clientless" mean?
                </para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>
                The term "clientless" means that no specific client is needed.
                A Guacamole user needs only have an HTML5 web browser
                installed, which is exceedingly common; virtually all modern
                computers and mobile devices have such a browser installed by
                default.
                </para>
                <para>
                    In this sense, Guacamole is "clientless" in that it does
                    not require any additional software to be installed
                    beyond what is considered standard for any computer.

            <question>
                <para>
                    Why does Guacamole not use WebSocket?

            <question>
                <para>
                    I have Tomcat (or some other servlet container) set up
                    behind a proxy (like mod_proxy) and cannot connect to
                    Guacamole. Why? How do I solve this?

            <question>
                <para>
                    I connect to the internet through a web proxy, and cannot
                    connect to Guacamole. I cannot reconfigure the proxy. How
                    do I solve this?

            <question>
                <para>
                    Can I buy special licensing of the Guacamole code base,
                    such that I can use it in my own product, without providing
                    the source to my users, without contributing back, and
                    without acknowledging the project?
                </para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>
                    No.

        <qandaentry>
            <question>
                <para>
                    Can I pay for custom Guacamole work, or for help
                    integrating Guacamole into my product, if the open source
                    nature and licenses are preserved?
                </para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>
                    Yes. We love to be paid to work on Guacamole,
                    especially if that work remains open source.
