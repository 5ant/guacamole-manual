    <title>Installing Guacamole</title>

    <!--

    <section id="getpackages">

        <title>Pre-built packages</title>

        <para>
            By far, the easiest way to install Guacamole is through pre-built
            binary packages. Binary packages are provided with every Guacamole
            release for several Linux distributions, and there may be Guacamole
            packages available in the official repository of your distribution.
        </para>

        <para>
            If your distribution provides Guacamole packages for you, this is
            the preferred method of installing Guacamole. Install your
            distribution's Guacamole package, and then follow the common
            instructions here for configuring Guacamole once it is installed.
        </para>

        <para>
            If your distribution does not provide Guacamole packages, or the
            packages provided are too old, you can try the packages built by
            the Guacamole project with every release. If the Guacamole project
            does not provide packages for your specific distribution, you will
            need to build everything yourself from source.
        </para>

        <section id="supported">

            <title>Supported distribution versions</title>

            <para>
                The Guacamole project supports all stable versions of Debian,
                Ubuntu, and Fedora which have not reached end-of-life. The
                only exception to this is when a particular version cannot
                be supported because the upstream repository is missing a
                critical dependency, in which case some or all of the
                packages built by the Guacamole project will not be available
                for that distribution.
            </para>

            <para>
                Packages for all supported versions of Linux distributions are
                available from the Guacamole project site at
                http://guac-dev.org/.
            </para>

        <section id="bindepends">

            <title>Installing Dependencies</title>

            <para>
                Different components of Guacamole depend on different packages
                provided by your distribution in order to function.
            </para>

            <para>
                The Guacamole web application depends on a servlet container
                like Apache Tomcat. This guide assumes you are using Apache
                Tomcat as your servlet container, but others will work as well.
                You will need to consult the documentation of your chosen
                servlet container for any details regarding installation of web
                applications.
            </para>

            <para>
                For Debian and Ubuntu, Apache Tomcat is provided by the
                <package>tomcat6</package> package, while the VNC library
                required for VNC support is provided by
                <package>libvncserver0</package>, and RDP support is provided
                by <package>libfreerdp1</package>.

            <para>
                The Apache Tomcat package for Fedora is also called

                <package>libvncserver</package>, and RDP support is provided by

            <para>
                Guacamole is built using Maven. Building Guacamole compiles all
                classes and packages them into a deployable
                <filename>.war</filename> file. This <filename>.war</filename>
                file can be installed and deployed under servlet containers like
                Apache Tomcat or Jetty.
            </para>

            <para>
                To build Guacamole using maven, simply run
                <command>mvn <option>package</option></command>.

            <para>
                Maven will download any needed dependencies for building
                the <filename>.war</filename> file. Once all dependencies
                have been downloaded, the <filename>.war</filename> file
                will be created in the <filename>target/</filename>
                subdirectory of the current directory.
