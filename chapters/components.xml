        Guacamole is not simply a web application. The Guacamole project
        encompasses several subprojects which make up the Guacamole core. The
        web application commonly known as "Guacamole" is simply a free and
        open-source remote desktop application powered by the core. The
        Guacamole core APIs are what make the web application possible.
