        <para>The C API for exdending and developing with Guacamole is libguac.
            All native components produced by the Guacamole project link with
            this library, and this library provides the common basis for
            extending the native functionality of those native components (by
            implementing client plugins).</para>
        <para>libguac is used mainly for developing client plugins like
            libguac-client-vnc or libguac-client-rdp, or for developing a proxy
            supporting the Guacamole protocol like guacd. This chapted is
            intended to give an overview of how libguac is used, and how to use
            it for general communication with the Guacamole protocol.</para>
