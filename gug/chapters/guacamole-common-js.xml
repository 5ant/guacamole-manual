        <para>The Guacamole project provides a JavaScript API for interfacing
            with other components that conform to the design of Guacamole, such
            as projects using libguac or guacamole-common. This API is called
            guacamole-common-js.</para>
        <para>guacamole-common-js provides a JavaScript implementation of a
            Guacamole client, as well as tunneling mechanisms for getting
            protocol data out of JavaScript and into guacd or the server side of
            a web application.</para>
        <para>For convenience, it also provides mouse and keyboard abstraction
            objects that translate JavaScipt mouse, touch, and keyboard events
            into consistent data that Guacamole can more easily digest. The
            extendable on-screen keyboard that was developed for the Guacamole
            web application is also included.</para>
