        If you want to access one or more desktops from anywhere remotely,
        without having to install a client, particularly when installing a
        client is not possible, Guacamole is an excellent solution. By
        setting up a Guacamole server, you can provide access to any other
        computer on the network from virtually any other computer on the
        internet, anywhere in the world. Even mobile phones or tablets can
        be used, without having to install anything.

        Another common reason is the presence of a corporate firewall at
        the workplace preventing SSH or other access to remote machines.
        Usually, such a firewall prevents access to anything other than
        HTTP or HTTPS, and corporate policies prohibit intentionally
        circumventing these restrictions (by changing port numbers, for
        example).
    </para>

    <para>
        As a true web application whose communication is over HTTP or HTTPS
        only, Guacamole allows you to access your machines from anywhere
        without violating the policy of your workplace, and without
        requiring the installation of special clients.
