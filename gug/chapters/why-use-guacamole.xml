    <section>
        <title>Access your computers from anywhere</title>
        <para>If you want to access one or more desktops from anywhere remotely,
            without having to install a client, particularly when installing a
            client is not possible, Guacamole is an excellent solution. By
            setting up a Guacamole server, you can provide access to any other
            computer on the network from virtually any other computer on the
            internet, anywhere in the world. Even mobile phones or tablets can
            be used, without having to install anything.</para>
        <para>Another common reason is the presence of a corporate firewall at
            the workplace preventing SSH or other access to remote machines.
            Usually, such a firewall prevents access to anything other than HTTP
            or HTTPS, and corporate policies prohibit intentionally
            circumventing these restrictions (by changing port numbers, for
            example).</para>
        <para>As a true web application whose communication is over HTTP or
            HTTPS only, Guacamole allows you to access your machines from
            anywhere without violating the policy of your workplace, and without
            requiring the installation of special clients.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Access your computers from any device</title>
        <para>As Guacamole requires only a reasonably-fast, standards-compliant
            browser, Guacamole will run on many devices, including mobile phones
            and tablets.</para>
        <para>Guacamole, especially the 0.7.0 release, is specifically designed
            to not care whether you have a mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, or any
            combination of those.</para>
        <para>One of the major design philosophies behind Guacamole is that it
            should never assume you have a particular device (ie: a mobile
            phone) just because your browser has or is missing a specific
            feature (ie: touch events or a smallish screen). Guacamole's
            codebase provides support for both mouse and touch events
            simultaneously, without choosing one over the other, while the
            interface is intended to be usable regardless of screen size.</para>
        <para>Barring bugs, you should be able to use Guacamole on just about
            any modern device with a web browser.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Keep a computer in the "cloud"</title>
        <para>Ignoring the buzzword, it's often useful to have a computer that
            has no dedicated physical hardware, where its processing and storage
            power are handled transparently by redundant systems in some remote
            datacenter.</para>
        <para>Computers hosted on virtualized hardware are more resilient to
            failures, and with so many companies now offering on-demand
            computing resources, Guacamole is a perfect way to access several
            machines that are only accessible over the internet.</para>
        <para>In fact, all Guacamole development is done on computers like this.
            This is partly because we like the mobility, and partly because we
            want to ensure Guacamole is always performant enough for daily
            use.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Providing easy access to a group</title>
        <para>Guacamole allows you to centralize access to a large group of
            machines, and specify on a per-user basis which machines are
            accessible. Rather than remember a list of machines and credentials,
            users need only log into a central server and click on one of the
            connections listed.</para>
        <para>If you have multiple computers which you would like to access
            remotely, or you are part of a group where each person has a set of
            machines that they need remote access to, Guacamole is a good way to
            provide that access while also ensuring that access is available
            from anywhere.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Adding HTML5 remote access to your existing
            infrastructure</title>
        <para>As Guacamole is an API, not just a web application, the core
            components and libraries provided by the Guacamole project can be
            used to add HTML5 remote access features to an existing application.
            You need not use the main Guacamole web application; you can write
            (or integrate with) your own rather easily.</para>
        <para>If you host an on-demand computing service, adding HTML5-based
            remote access allows users of your service more broad access; users
            need nothing more than a web browser to see their computers'
            screens.</para>
